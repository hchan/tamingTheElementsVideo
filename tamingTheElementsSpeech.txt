Taming the Elements is an arena-combat/strategy game about leveling and building
a Garrion of elementals.
Your garrison is your collection of elementals, that you gain throughout the game by capturing other elementals.
You begin the game with just one elemental, but in this saved instance,
which is near the end game, I have collected all 12 playable characters, each having different abilities.
Besides abilities, each character will have different attributes such as health, speed and elemental type.  The elemental type dictates the amount of damage that you can do against another elemental.  There are 4 types of elementals: earth, fire, air and water.

The main play for this game is in the battleground.
In the later chapters of this game, you will form a team of 3 elementals of your choosing in your garrison.  After you select your team, you can enter the battleground and try to gain XP by defeating the opposing team.
As each character has different playing styles against the opposing team, you can swap characters within your team during the battle.
Strategize on which one of your elementals would do best against the current
opponent.  You should also time your swapping not just based upon the
opposing team's roster and current opponent but also on your cooldowns
and HP.  
Rest your current character in the battleground by tagging in another
character via an action hotkey.  Non-active aka benched characters in battle
gain rest HP overtime up to half of the amount of damage done in the
previous swap.
When a player swaps with a teammate, the member that just tagged in will
be teleported to the starting position of the battle.  This teleportation
feature can also be used as a strategy to move away quickly from melee
attackers.
